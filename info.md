AI-powered payment system on Arc using USDC. Agent-Pay automates conditional B2B transactions with an AI agent that makes decisions and executes instant on-chain settlements with full stability and transparency.

# Long 

Agent-Pay is an AI-driven conditional payment platform built on the Arc blockchain using USDC. It eliminates slow, manual B2B transactions by introducing a self-governing agent that makes financial decisions, validates preconditions, and executes verified blockchain payments autonomously.

The system uses a hybrid AI architecture—a Python/Flask “Brain” that manages payment states (MONITORING, PAID) and performs pre-checks, and a Node.js backend “Executor” that securely handles on-chain settlement. This design ensures full reliability and predictable outcomes.

Key innovations include a stability-focused voice flow, bypassing flaky external APIs for guaranteed live execution, and an INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE pre-check that prevents failed transactions. The frontend dashboard offers real-time payment visibility, time-sorted logs, and collapsible views for clarity.

Developed for the Circle x Arc Hackathon, Agent-Pay v4.11 demonstrates the future of programmable finance—where AI agents trigger conditional, compliant, and instantly verifiable USDC payments on Arc. It represents a concrete step toward autonomous, intelligent finance systems designed for real-world enterprise automation.
